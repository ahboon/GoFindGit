# GoFindGit
Inspired by https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools/blob/master/Finder/gitfinder.py, I decided to write this in Go.

## Note
Still a work in progress. Not the ideal version yet.


# Usage
Build the binary
```go build -o gofindgit main.go```

Run the binary
```./gofindgit <domains_text_file_name>```

Modes:
- git 
- env


## Things to do
To do:
- [ ] Add limit to number of go routines
- [ ] Add functionality to dump git files
- [ ] Add additional support for other requests (just a random thought)


# Support?
I am also open to contributions, suggestions and feedback!
